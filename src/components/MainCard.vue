                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> Dameer is a Bioengineering student at Imperial College London, 
                    determined to see how far we can engineer our biology to optimise our lives. 
                    This interest, however, developed from experiences he faced in his younger years. 
                    During his A-levels, where he took Further Maths, Maths, Physics, Computer Science 
                    and an EPQ, he was diagnosed with medical issues that severely hindered his 
                    self-control. It was here that he became obsessed with "finding a cure" - immersing 
                    himself in behavioural theories and neuroscience - to better understand his own mind. 
                    Next, he wrote his extended project qualification (EPQ) about curing such ailments 
                    in the brain: behaviours like procrastination. Alarmingly, he discovered an 
                    ever-increasing struggle among humans to battle their own minds. 
                    In his research, he details that in our digital age, the overwhelming distractions 
                    we face cause our brains to devolve.
                    Alongside this, a slow frustration brewed as he journeyed through secondary school, 
                    seeing his peers quit and drop subjects because they saw themselves as 'inadequate'. 
                    Even though he felt they were far brighter than himself â€” it was almost as if they 
                    had placed themselves "in a box". This sentiment still bothers him to this day: 
                    strong belief that everyone is capable, but the high barrier of entry of self-belief 
                    stops people from achieving their goals. This 'friction' needs to be overcome for 
                    intentional change, and it's only getting more challenging in our distractable age.
                    Dameer has always been a tinkerer. This is why he founded his school's Robotics Society. 
                    He also knew many students loved this area but had no idea where to start. Once again, 
                    it was a perceived high barrier to entry, so creating this society was a way of demystifying 
                    the complexities and allowing people to nurture their passion. Due to the society's success, 
                    it was approved to receive the school's extracurricular STEM to fund the projects.    
                    Similar to this endeavour, he believes in being proactive to problems. 
                    He noticed the lack of teaching on financial knowledge in the school curricula, 
                    so he founded the Investment Education Society, where he invited the CEO of Path Financial, 
                    a financial advisory firm, to give a talk and educate students. 
                    Now at Imperial, he has combined his passions for neuroscience and engineering to found 
                    the UK's first university-led Neurotechnology society. He has been the project lead for 
                    the society's first funded product, which received further grants from startup competitions.
                    He seeks to spread awareness of the dangers of today's increasingly distracted world, 
                    shining the light on the importance of self-awareness and harnessing 
                    new technology to pave the way to a more intentional life and future.
